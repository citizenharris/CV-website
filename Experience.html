					<p class="bold">Arabic & Middle Eastern Analyst</p>
					<time datetime="2016-01-01" class="bold">January 2016</time> - <time datetime="2016-12-15" class="bold">December 2016</time>
					<p>Using my language skills, as well as dozens of OSINT analytical tools and sources, I have worked on bespoke intelligence reports focussed on the Middle East and South America. These reports have centred on terrorist activity in Syria, accounting for both events on the ground and the implications these actions might have.</p>
					<p>Additionally, I have delivered corporate due diligence reports using public domain research as well as OSINT tools to extract further information. As an ethical intelligence consultancy, Neon Century is concerned with matters like reputational risk and operates within transparency laws to deliver actionable intelligence.</p>

					<p class="bold">Profile Writer</p>
					<time datetime="2014-12-05" class="bold">December 2014</time> - <time datetime="2015-07-15" class="bold">July 2015</time>
					<p>Over the course of eight months I produced several features, as well as a series of short news stories, for a start-up magazine on a freelance basis. I was required to transcribe and extrapolate pre-recorded interviews into a coherent and well-written feature-length article. These interviews were often with non-native English speakers. The articles were about Higher Education institutions that incorporated sustainable practices and triple bottom line accounting into their curricula and operations.</p>
					<p>This job required excellent time management skills in order to meet deadlines. It also necessitated a good writing style. As part of the writing process I had to research and verify the accuracy of statistics given during the interview.</p>

					<p class="bold"><a href="http://www.aegisworld.com/" target="_blank">Aegis Advisory</a></p>
					<p class="bold">Intern</p>
					<time datetime="2014-09-01" class="bold">September 2014</time><time datetime="2014-09-15" class="bold"></time>
					<p>My internship at Aegis Advisory included diverse work. Although I favoured working within the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) unit I did occasionally work with the African and Latin American teams. This involved researching companies and agencies and providing reports on commercial interests and a general briefing of the company. Working with the MENA unit I was tasked with monitoring several Arab countries and giving regular updates about any situation occurring on the ground. This was achieved by scanning local news and following social media.</p>
					<p>Because of my work with the MENA unit I was referred to the kidnapping and ransoms division of the company where I provided research and analytical assistance. The bulk of my assignments with this division comprised researching and collating information.</p>
					<p>In addition to this, every morning I would scan national and international daily newspapers and pick out news stories most likely to affect geopolitics and international economies which I would then summarise and send to the entire company by email.</p>
